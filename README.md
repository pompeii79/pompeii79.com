=============

Pompeii79.com is my personal website to showcase my work.  Included in this repository are examples of some emails I created.  I used emailonacid.com to test every email in most versions of most email clients, including mobile.  I used tables and inline CSS due to the current limitations on HTML emails.  I would never use such tactics on any other product than emails.
